# JS_Game

A JavaScript game designed to mimic old text-based games, like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

I was experimenting with alternatives to if and switch statements. I found a blog discussing replacing them with Object Literals.

I got the idea after completing Codeademy's JS course. It has a mini-project of a choose your own adventure game,
and I decided to extend it a bit.

It's still a work in progress. I have most of the basic funtionality working. I need to finish the actual story,
and add some location variables. I also would like to figure out a way of saving the player's progress.
